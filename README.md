## Core game loop

### Starting
We start the loop with a map divided in blocks. There is only one player in this version, he spawns with a building that displays the city the player owns. With the building comes a playable unit, it is possible to move around the map with our mouse and click on a block to move the unit.
For the moment there is not a real turn by turn feature because there is only one player.
